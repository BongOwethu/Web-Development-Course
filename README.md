> 🖤Building websites is the FASTEST way to become a software engineer. Here's my FREE curriculum on web development. 👑

### Traversy Media 📷
In my previous video, I recommended the YouTube channel freeCodeCamp and its free tutorials for my general software development curriculum. For web development, however, I’m introducing the channel Traversy Media and their free crash courses. And no, this isn’t a sponsorship; it’s my genuine recommendation. I learned React and Vue from their classes, too. My curriculum is a series of their courses I hand-picked myself. If I were to learn web development from scratch, this is the order I would do it.

### Frontend, Backend, and Full-Stack 🖥️
Let’s start with the basics. What are frontend, backend, and full-stack? Frontend refers to the webpage and its interfaces that users can see and interact with. Simply put, everything you see on amazon.com, the texts, images, buttons, and layout, falls under the frontend. On the contrary, the backend refers to everything else behind the scenes. When you click the “Place your order” button, your card gets charged, shipping gets tracked, and the delivery estimate is calculated. That’s because backend developers have instructed the servers to do so under the hood. Lastly, a full-stack developer is an engineer capable of doing both.

### Frontend 📱
Let’s dive deeper into the frontend. A website’s three basic building blocks are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML controls the structure of a website. It tells the browser to place a button here. CSS is responsible for its decoration. It stylizes the button by defining its position, color, and size. Lastly, JavaScript tells the browser what to do when clicking the button. For example, sign in to Amazon. But where do we learn about the building blocks? Traversy Media. Follow their crash courses in my curriculum. Some are a few years old, but that’s okay because fundamentals do not change. Another thing I love about their content is that it’s less than 90 minutes and packed with just the essentials.

### Bootstrap 🥾
Next up, Bootstrap. Bootstrap is the most popular free CSS framework for developing a responsive website. A website is responsive if the appearance changes depending on the screen size. For example, this is how my website looks on a PC. This is how it looks on a phone.
