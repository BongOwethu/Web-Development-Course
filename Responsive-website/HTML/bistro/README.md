### Case study
- The owners of the Black Tour Bistro have decided that they want a webite and to share recipes and news on their
site. In the exercises in this chapter, weâ€™ll assist them with content markup.
In this exercise, you will find the raw text of a recipe. Itâ€™s up to you to decide which
element is the best semantic match for each chunk of content. 
Here,Youâ€™ll use paragraphs,headings, lists, and at least one special content element.
