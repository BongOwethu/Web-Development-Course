### Case study
- The owners of the Black Goose Bistro have decided that they want a webite and to share recipes and news on their
site. In the exercises in this chapter, we’ll assist them with content markup.
In this exercise, you will find the raw text of a recipe. It’s up to you to decide which
element is the best semantic match for each chunk of content. 
Here,You’ll use paragraphs,headings, lists, and at least one special content element.
