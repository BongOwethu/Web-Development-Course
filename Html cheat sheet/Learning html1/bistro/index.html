<h2>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h2>
<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it’s always a big hit at
parties. My father recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just
bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try
serving it warm."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h4><u>Ingredients</u></h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
  <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
  <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
  <li>1 t. capers</li>
</ul>

<h4><u>Instructions</u></h4>
<ol>
  <li>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible.</li>
  <li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some texture.</li>
  <li>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</li>

  <h1>Low and Slow</h1>

posted by BGB, November 15, 2016
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>
Location: Baker’s Corner, Seekonk, MA
Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm
